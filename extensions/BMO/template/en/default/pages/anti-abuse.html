<p>
It is our intention that [% terms.Bugzilla %] remains a useful tool for reporting 
and commenting on [% terms.bugs %], feature-requests and tasks for the Mozilla community.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep [% terms.Bugzilla %] a useful, inclusive place for this work, we have 
<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html">guidelines</a> 
for using this site which, by using this site, you agree to follow.
</p>

<p>
If you find a bugzilla.mozilla.org user violating these guidelines in comments on bugs, 
please <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/BMO/comment_tagging">tag the comments</a> in question so 
that an administrator can review them. 
<p>

<p>If a comment is abusive or threatening use the tag <b><i>admin</i></b>. An admin will 
receive a notification shortly and be able to follow up. Bugs with comments marked 'spam',
and 'advocacy' will also be reviewed.
</p>

<p>
If a [% terms.bug %]'s short-description or whiteboard tags violate our guidelines,
please describe the issue in a comment and tag it <b><i>admin</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
If another [% terms.Bugzilla %] user asks you to stop a behavior, stop doing it. 
If an administrator asks you to stop engaging in a behavior, do it. Administrators 
have the discretion to limit or suspend your account, and take further actions 
if necessary if you violate our guidelines.
</p>

<p>
Questions about this policy should be addressed to 
<a href="mailto:bugzilla-admin@mozilla.org">bugzilla-admin@mozilla.org</a>. 
If you need to contact a bugzilla community administrator immediately, 
please contact an administrator in the #bmo channel on irc.mozilla.org.
