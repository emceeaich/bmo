[% PROCESS global/header.html.tmpl 
   title = "Bugzilla Etiquette" 
   style = "li { margin: 5px } .heading { font-weight: bold }" %]

<p>
It is our intention that [% terms.Bugzilla %] remains a useful tool for reporting 
and commenting on [% terms.bugs %], feature-requests and tasks for the Mozilla community.
</p>

<p>
In order to keep [%+ terms.Bugzilla %] a useful, inclusive place for this work, we have 
guidelines for using this site which, by using this site, you agree to follow.
</p>

<p>
Violations of these guidelines will be considered as grounds for suspending your privileges
to use this site, or suspend your account altogether.
</p>

<h3>Commenting</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <span class="heading">No abusing people</span>.
  Constant and intense critique is one of the reasons we build great products. 
  It's harder to fall into group-think if there is always a healthy amount of
  dissent. We want to encourage vibrant debate inside of the Mozilla 
  community, we want you to disagree with us, and we want you to effectively 
  argue your case. However, we require that in the process, you attack 
  <i>things</i>, not <i>people</i>. Examples of things include: interfaces,
  algorithms, and schedules. Examples of people include: developers,
  designers and users. <b>Attacking a person may result in you being banned 
  from [% terms.Bugzilla %].</b>  
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="heading">No obligation</span>.
  "Open Source" is not the same as "the developers must do my bidding."
  Everyone here wants to help, but no one else has any <i>obligation</i> to fix
  the [% terms.bugs %] you want fixed. Therefore, you should not act as if you
  expect someone to fix a [% terms.bug %] by a particular date or release.
  Aggressive or repeated demands will not be received well and will almost
  certainly diminish the impact and interest in your suggestions.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <span class="heading">No spam</span>.
  Posting comment spam will lead to the supsension of your account.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="heading">No pointless comments</span>.
  Limit comments on a [% terms.bug %] to information which will help with 
  resolving it. Unless requested, additional "I see this too" or "It works for me" 
  comments are unnecessary unless they are on a different platform or a significantly 
  different build.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="heading">No private email</span>.
  Do not send comments to bugs by private email; no-one else can read
  them if you do that, and they'll be missed and/or ignored. If an attachment
  is too big for [% terms.Bugzilla %], add a comment giving the file size and contents
  and ask what to do.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Changing Fields</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <span class="heading">No messing with other people's [% terms.bugs %]</span>.
  Unless you are the [% terms.bug %] assignee, or have some say over the use of their
  time, never change the Priority or Target Milestone fields. If in doubt, 
  do not change the fields of [% terms.bugs %] you do not own - add a comment
  instead, suggesting the change.
  </li>

  <li>
  <span class="heading">No whining about decisions</span>.
  If another project contributor has marked a [% terms.bug %] as INVALID, then it is
  invalid. Filing another duplicate of it does not change this. Unless
  you have further evidence to support this, do not post a comment arguing that an
  INVALID or WONTFIX [% terms.bug %] should be reopened. 
  </li> 

</ol>

<p>
  If you observe, or are the subject of behavior in violation of these guidelines, please tag
  the bug or comment following our <a href="page.cgi?id=anti-abuse.html">anti abuse policy</a>.
